	abstract = {The slot allocation mechanism aims to match flight demand and airport resources from a strategic perspective. However, current research mainly focused on airlines’ interests, ignoring the influencing factors that lead to primary delays, which makes the temporal and spatial distribution of flight schedules unreasonable. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to reduce operational delays at a strategic level by considering operational efficiency and airline interests. The displacement probability distribution between the actual execution time and the scheduled time is first mined from the historical operation data. We then develop a model with the ultimate objective of improving the punctuality rate and reducing the actual operational delays by minimizing the total operational displacement. In addition to considering the basic operational restrictions of airports, the model also introduces the corridor capacity of the terminal airspace surrounding an airport, reducing the delay caused by the corridor flow control to a certain extent. The proposed model is applied to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport in China. The experimental results suggest that the optimized flight schedule can significantly reduce flight delay, conforms to airport operational restrictions, and maintains flight connectivity.},

	abstract = {Access at the vast majority of busy airports located outside the United States is subject to schedule coordination. These airports declare a value of capacity and allocate a corresponding number of slots to the airlines. Slot allocation follows rules and priorities established by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which introduce coupling constraints across the allocation of slots at multiple times of the day and on multiple days of the year. As a result, slot allocation is a highly complex combinatorial problem, which carries enormous weight for airlines, airports, and passengers. Integer programming models have been proposed to support slot allocation by minimizing deviations from the airlines’ requests. Because of the problem’s complexity, these models have been only successfully implemented at small- and medium-sized airports. This paper develops an original algorithm based on large-scale neighborhood search to solve the slot allocation problem at the largest schedule-coordinated airports. The proposed algorithm combines a constructive heuristic, which provides an initial feasible solution in short computational times, and an improvement heuristic, which iteratively reoptimizes slot allocation by subdividing the slot requests into smaller subsets. The algorithm is implemented at Lisbon’s Airport (LIS), one of the top-20 busiest airports in Europe. Results suggest that it can provide optimal or near-optimal solutions in a few hours of computation, while direct implementation of existing optimization models with commercial solvers does not terminate after several days of computation. Ultimately, the proposed approach considerably enhances the capabilities of slot allocation models and algorithms.},

	abstract = {Air traﬃc demand has grown to exceed available capacity during extended parts of each day at many of the busiest airports worldwide. Absent opportunities for capacity expansion, this may require the use of demand management measures to restore the balance between scheduled traﬃc and available capacity. The main demand management mechanism in use today is the administrative schedule coordination process operated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is in place at the great majority of busy airports outside the United States. This paper proposes a novel multi-objective Prioritybased Slot Allocation Model (PSAM) that optimizes slot allocation, while complying with the complex set of priorities and requirements speciﬁed by the IATA guidelines, as well as with the declared capacity constraints at the airports. It presents an eﬃcient computational approach that provides optimal slot allocation solutions at airports signiﬁcantly larger than has been possible to date. The model is applied to two Portuguese airports, a small one (Madeira) and a mid-size one (Porto) using highly detailed data on airline slot requests and airport capacity constraints. Results suggest that PSAM can improve the eﬃciency of current practice by providing slot allocations that match better the slot requests of airlines. Equally important, PSAM can also quantify the sensitivity of slot allocation decisions to the various priorities and requirements speciﬁed in the IATA guidelines.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the allocation of slots for a network of coordinated (congested) airports, where the term ‘‘slot” refers to a time on a speciﬁc day when a carrier is given permission to use the full range of airport infrastructure for the purpose of landing and takeoff at a slot-controlled airport. We take into account the existing IATA rules and guidelines: priorities of requests for slots, the capacity limitations at each airport, the minimal turnaround time between arrival and subsequent departure of the same aircraft, and allocation to series of slots rather than to individual slots. Given the complexity of the problem, we propose an approach that consists of (i) a constructive heuristic procedure to generate a feasible and coherent allocation of slots for each airport from the network, and (ii) an iterative heuristic to improve the quality of an initial feasible solution in terms of the schedule delay (time difference between allocated time slots and airline requests). To evaluate whether the approach would be practical in real operation, we perform tests on a set of generated benchmark instances that span an entire scheduling season. The instances differ by the number of airports in the network and by the distribution of requests among airports from a given network - the largest number of airports forming a network is 100, while the maximum total number of aircraft movements considered on a half-yearly basis exceeds 4:6 106. We provide computational comparisons with solutions obtained when each airport from a network is considered independently (the en-route constraint is ignored). These results reveal that the consideration of the en-route constraint, which ensures a coherent allocation of slots at origin and destination airports, introduces only a minor degradation in the schedule delay and in the number of unaccommodated requests. Furthermore, we investigate the heuristic performance for reduced-capacity scenarios.},

	abstract = {Predicting ﬂight delays has been a major research topic in the past few decades. Various machine learning algorithms have been used to predict ﬂight delays in short-range horizons (e.g., a few hours or days prior to operation). Airlines have to develop ﬂight schedules several months in advance; thus, predicting ﬂight delays at the strategic stage is critical for airport slot allocation and airlines’ operation. However, less work has been dedicated to predicting ﬂight delays at the strategic phase. This paper proposes machine learning methods to predict the distributions of delays. Three metrics are developed to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Empirical data from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport are used to validate the methods. Computational results show that the prediction accuracy of departure delay at the 0.65 conﬁdence level and the arrival delay at the 0.50 conﬁdence level can reach 0.80 without the input of ATFM delay. Our work provides an alternative tool for airports and airlines managers for estimating ﬂight delays at the strategic phase.},

	abstract = {In the absence of opportunities for capacity expansion or operational enhancements, air traﬃc congestion mitigation may require scheduling interventions aimed to control the extent of overcapacity scheduling at busy airports. Previous research has shown that large delay reductions could be achieved through comparatively small changes in the schedule of ﬂights. While existing approaches have focused on minimizing the overall impact of scheduling interventions across the airlines, this paper designs, optimizes, and assesses a novel approach for airport scheduling interventions that incorporates inter-airline equity objectives. It relies on a lexicographic modeling architecture based on eﬃciency (i.e., meeting airline scheduling preferences), equity (i.e., balancing scheduling adjustments fairly among the airlines), and on-time performance (i.e., mitigating airport congestion) objectives, subject to scheduling and network connectivity constraints. Theoretical results show that, under some scheduling conditions, equity and eﬃciency can be jointly maximized. Computational results suggest that, under a wide range of current and hypothetical scheduling settings, ignoring inter-airline equity can lead to highly inequitable outcomes, but that our modeling approach achieves inter-airline equity at no, or small, losses in eﬃciency.},

	abstract = {Slot scheduling has emerged as an issue of major concern at congested airports. A commonly used metric for assessing airport slot scheduling efficiency is total schedule displacement. In addition to schedule efficiency, fairness has also been identified as another important slot scheduling criterion. However, the literature currently does not provide sufficient modelling capabilities for investigating the single airport slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off. The objective of this paper is to develop and solve a novel airport slot scheduling model which considers simultaneously slot scheduling efficiency and fairness objectives. We introduce a fairness metric for slot scheduling and formulate the airport slot scheduling problem as a bi-objective optimization model which considers fairness and efficiency simultaneously. We use an integrated solution framework that combines the ε-constraint method and a row generation algorithm to solve the proposed bi-objective model. We investigate the slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off under the following two slot scheduling regimes: (i) a regime that considers historical slot usage rights (hierarchical), and (ii) a regime that does not consider historical slot usage rights (nonhierarchical). The proposed model generates the efficient frontiers describing the slot scheduling efficiency-fairness trade-off for both slot scheduling regimes. The results of the model are presented at the aggregate (airport-wide) and disaggregate (individual) airline level providing information that enhances the transparency of slot scheduling decisions. The efficient frontiers produced by the proposed model can facilitate discussions among different stakeholders in making slot scheduling decisions.},

	abstract = {Fairness constitutes an important criterion for allocating scarce resources among self-interested parties. The capacity of congested airports is a scarce resource which is allocated in the form of slots to airlines to operate their flights. Traditionally, the optimisation of slot allocation efficiency has been considered as the primary criterion in making slot allocation decisions at capacity-constrained airports. The efficiency of slot allocation is expressed as a function of displacement, which is defined as the difference between the time requested by the airlines and the time allocated to airlines to operate their flights. Recent research work has considered fairness as an additional slot allocation objective. However, the literature has not adequately addressed the following two key research questions: i) in the presence of alternative fairness measures, which fairness measure should be used to investigate the slot allocation efficiency-fairness tradeoff, and how the choice of the efficient frontier describing this trade-off should be made? and ii) given that the choice of the efficient frontier has been made, which slot allocation solution should be selected for implementation, and how this choice should be made? To address these questions, we investigate three inter-airline fairness objectives, and we introduce a decision-making framework to assist decision-makers in identifying the most preferable acceptable slot allocation outcome. The proposed decision-making framework is based on a voting mechanism which incorporates the preferences of stakeholders. We use slot request and capacity data to determine the most preferable slot allocation outcome at a capacity-constrained airport.},

From an operating standpoint, assessing the beneﬁts of demand management requires estimates of airport capacity and models of airport on-time performance. From a managerial standpoint, the design of demand management mechanisms can be supported by decision-making models of ﬂight scheduling. From an economic standpoint, the welfare impact of congestion pricing, slot controls and slot auctions depends on the market structure at the airport.

This mechanism: (a) ensures that the slots are allocated according to the true valuations of airlines, (b) provides fair opportunities for flights connecting remote cities to large airports, and (c) controls the number of flights in each slot to minimize congestion. Drawing inspiration from economic theory, this mechanism allocates the slots based on an affine maximizer allocation rule and charges payments to the airlines to incentivize them to participate in the allocation process and reveal their actual valuations. The allocation also optimizes the occupancy of each slot to keep them as uncongested as possible. The formulation solves an optimal integral solution in strongly polynomial time. We conduct experiments on the data collected from two primary airports in India. We also compare our results with existing allocations and an allocation based on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) guidelines. The computational results show that our mechanism is more egalitarian and generates 20\% − 30\% higher social utility than the IATA based state-of-the-art approach and current allocations.},

	abstract = {The continuous growth of air trafﬁc, together with limited existing airport infrastructures, have resulted in air trafﬁc demand-capacity imbalances, airport congestion and arrival/departure ﬂight delays. To address this, large European airports implement strategic ﬂight schedules, i.e., up to 6 months prior to the day of the ﬂight execution, ﬂights are assigned arrival and departure time slots. The allocation of slots is performed by airport slot coordinators, which strive to accommodate the requests of airlines for arrival/departure slots, while taking into account airport’s capacity and current IATA slot allocation guidelines. To support this process, several deterministic optimisation models for slot allocation have been proposed. However, the resulting ﬂight schedules assume ideal conditions, .i.e., potential ﬂight delays or cancellations are not considered. In this paper we propose for the ﬁrst time a machine learning-based approach to assess the strategic ﬂight schedules in terms of potential arrival/departure ﬂight delays and cancellations. We ﬁrst propose algorithms to classify the strategic, scheduled ﬂights as delayed or cancelled. Further, we use these results as input for a generic ﬂight schedule assessment methodology based on a relative on-time airport performance comparison of the considered strategic schedules. We demonstrate our methodology by assessing 10 strategic ﬂight schedules in the period 2013-2018 at London Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest airports in Europe. Together with the development of dedicated strategic ﬂight schedule optimization models, our proposed approach supports an integrated strategic ﬂight schedule assessment, where strategic ﬂight schedules are evaluated with respect to ﬂight delays and cancellations.},

Access to these highly congested (Level 3, coordinated) airports is controlled through the use of the IATA World Airport Slot allocation Guidelines (WASG). At an individual airport, slots requested by each airline are allocated at the airport under consideration independently without taking into account the interactions between slots allocated at different airports. However, in order for the air-transport network to operate seamlessly, ensuring network-wide connectivity of flights, and the interdependencies existing between the slots allocated at individual airports need to be considered. Several models have been proposed in the literature to deal with the optimum allocation of slots at a single airport. However, the literature currently does not adequately address the network-wide slot allocation problem. In this paper, we are introducing a novel approach to address the network-wide slot allocation problem. Our approach considers as an input the individual airport schedules generated during the slot allocation process at individual airports and optimally adjusts them to ensure network-wide flight connectivity by taking into account the interdependencies existing between flights connecting pairs of airports.},

The aggregate level uses a two-stage model to minimize the sum of displacement cost and delay cost in the worst-case scenario using Benders’ Decomposition-based algorithm. At the individual level, an integer linear programming model is developed based on the results from the aggregate level to provide specific departure slot and arrival slot for each flight. An airport network composed of 15 coordinated airports in China is studied and shows that by experimental analysis the overall optimization method is capable of providing robust and efficient solutions for slot allocation and benefits from high computational efficiency. The outperformance of the twostage optimization method from the aggregate level is also illustrated in comparison with the one-stage optimization method. Finally, recommendations for the slot allocation policy in practice are provided.},

	abstract = {Prior research on slot allocation has focused on a single airport, with little attention paid to the multiple-airport systems (MAS) that consist of at least two major airports. Scheduled flights at different airports may have conflicts regarding shared fixes (i.e., route points) or routes, thus causing airspace congestion and flight delays. Traffic demand at a critical fix depends on both the departure/arrival time of the flights and the flying times between the airport and the fix, whereas flying times exhibit a stochastic nature due to various factors such as air traffic control strategies, aircraft performance, and weather. In this paper, we develop a chance-constrained slot allocation model for an MAS that optimizes slot allocation for multiple airports while considering fix capacity constraints. To capture the uncertainty of flying times, stochastic chance constraints are formulated and a scenario generation method is proposed to solve the model. We apply our model to allocate slots in the MAS of Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay area. The results show that the schedules generated by the proposed model outperform those from the certainty model and the original schedules. Traffic flow at critical fixes is more robust to various operating scenarios with the cost of a small number of increased slot displacements. Our findings highlight the importance of flying time uncertainty in allocating slot and airspace capacity, and the proposed model provides a useful tool for slot coordinators seeking to effectively manage airport slots in an MAS.},

First, they provide an optimization tool to allocate time slots, which takes several operational aspects and airline preferences into account; second, they execute the process on a network of airports; and third they explicitly include uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge, these are the ﬁrst models for time slot allocation to consider both the stochastic nature of capacity reductions and the problem’s network structure. From a practical viewpoint, the proposed models provide important insights for the allocation of time slots. Speciﬁcally, they highlight the tradeoff between the schedule/request discrepancies, i.e., the time difference between allocated time slots and airline requests, and operational delays. Increasing schedule/request discrepancies enables a reduction in operational delays. Moreover, the models are computationally viable. A set of realistic test instances that consider the scheduling of four calendar days on different European airport networks has been solved within reasonable – for the application’s context – computation times. In one of our test instances, we were able to reduce the sum of schedule/request discrepancies and operational delays by up to 58\%. This work provides slot coordinators with a valuable decision making tool, and it indicates that the proposed approach is very promising and may lead to relevant monetary savings for airlines and aircraft operators.},

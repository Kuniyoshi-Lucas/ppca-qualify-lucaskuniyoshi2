\label{section:Introduction}
The present paper introduces two main reasons to elevate the efficiency in the initial slot allocation in an airport, a Brazilian medium hub case. The first reason is related to the airport's ways to generate revenue. The airport revenue is mainly generated through aeronautical charges and commercial exploitation, both of which are directly related to the traffic volume. In \cite{graham2009}, for example, it is discussed the importance of the commercial revenues, which represented (2017) 52.9\% of the total airport revenue to Africa and the Middle East, 45.7\% to Asia and Pacific, 38.1\% to Europe, 52.6\% to North America, and only 29.0\% to Latin America and the Caribbean. The article blames the small exploitation of airports' commercial areas in Latin America and the Caribbean on the lack of airport traffic stimulus, which results in the full dependence of the regulated airport fares, and non-development in both commercial and aeronautic areas.

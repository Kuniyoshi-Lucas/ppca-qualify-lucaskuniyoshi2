\midrule
2 & \citeonline{ribeiro_large-scale_2019} - Research paper & A large-scale neighborhood search approach to airport slot allocation & Heuristic solution method and integer programming method (Single airport) & \acrlong{LIS} (two seasons) & The authors' algorithm produced solutions within 0.1\% of the optimum in just a few hours. \\
\midrule
3 & \citeonline{zografos2017increasing} - Integrated review & Increasing airport capacity utilisation through optimum slot scheduling: review of current developments and identification of future needs & Literature review & N/A &  This review encompassed 96 research papers published between 1993 and 2014, developing a classification system for the approaches used in the slot allocation problem.\\
\midrule
4 & \citeonline{ribeiro2018optimization} - Research paper & An optimization approach for airport slot allocation under \acrshort{IATA} guidelines & Integer programming method (Single airport)   & Madeira and Porto airports (one season)  & The model improves slot allocation outcomes by reducing the displacement experienced by airlines by an estimated 4.5\% at Madeira and 27\% at Porto. \\

8 & \citeonline{zografos_bi-objective_2019} & A bi-objective efficiency-fairness model for scheduling slots at congested airports & Bi-objective modelling framework (Single Airport) &  Data resembling real world conditions of a Coordinated Airport (one season) & The paper presents a bi-objective model that combines efficiency and fairness. The model uses the $\epsilon$-constraint method, where one objective (fairness) is turned into a constraint and then iteratively tightened to explore trade-offs between fairness and efficiency.  \\

9 & \citeonline{jiang_decision_2021} & A decision making framework for incorporating fairness in allocating slots at capacity-constrained airports &  Bi-objective modelling framework (Single Airport) & One airport (one season) & The paper presents a framework that combines efficiency and fairness. A key innovation is the incorporation of a voting mechanism. Airlines express their willingness to trade-off efficiency for fairness depending on their individual weight. \\
